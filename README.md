# 📧 Jacob Yim - Phishing Email Detector (Work In Progress)

This project aims to build a simple phishing email classification model using a pre-trained DistilBERT model from Hugging Face.  
The model was fine-tuned in Google Colab on a small custom dataset to classify emails as either phishing or legitimate.

🚧 **Work in Progress**  
This project is still under development and will be updated with more data, fine-tuning, and evaluation in the future.
